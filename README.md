# Game-of-Life
A simple GUI implementation of the Conway's Game of Life

To get started, you can build the game from the makefile, and then load the unity tests to make sure that they work.
Then you can load the game, by pressing 1 in the command line interface option, and press y/n to advance to the next time state

I have also included a video showing the implementation of the game of life with the GUI
